## Open Kart – Game Features
# 1. Main Menu & Navigation
The game begins with a main menu offering options: Play, Explore, Compete, and Exit. Players use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate and Enter/Space to select. The HUD consistently displays Lives and Score, with Collisions shown during races.
# 2. Camera Control
Players can pause the game with P. The camera defaults to third-person but supports left, right, and front angles. First-person mode can be toggled with F for immersive gameplay.
# 3. Play Mode (Single Race)
Players choose from 3 tracks:
•	Sunny Oval (trees)
•	Frozen Square (ice statues)
•	Night Circuit (rocks)
The player spawns near a kart, pressing Space to start. Kart controls: W/S/A/D to accelerate, brake, and steer.
# 4. Collisions System
Hitting track walls or opponents increases Collision Count. When Collisions ≥ 5, the player loses 1 life and respawns. This system adds challenge and consequence to reckless driving.
# 5. Lap & Race Rules
Each race consists of 2 laps. The winner is determined by who crosses the finish line first, introducing competitive pacing.
# 6. Power-ups
Players can collect or purchase power-ups:
•	Boost: lasts 7 seconds, costs 5 coins.
•	Autopilot: lasts 10 seconds, costs 10 coins.
These items add strategic variety to racing.
# 7. Weapons & Combat
Players can use a Rifle (Q) and Missile Launcher (E) with limited ammunition to hinder opponents. This adds combat elements to the racing environment.
# 8. Track Obstacles & Extras
Tracks feature obstacles and collectible blue orbs. Obstacles challenge navigation, while orbs provide large boosts for speed advantage.
# 9. Explore Mode (Free Walk)
Players can leave the kart and explore the island tracks on foot using W/S/A/D. Coins are scattered across the environment, adding exploration rewards.
# 10. Coin Collection & Timer
Collected coins extend the timer. The game ends when the timer reaches zero, making coin collection vital for continued exploration.
# 11. Boost Skill (Explore Mode)
On-foot characters can activate a Boost Skill with B, using up to 2 charges that slowly refill over time. This encourages tactical exploration.
# 12. Opponent Karts in Explore Mode
Even in Explore Mode, opponent karts roam the tracks, adding a layer of unpredictability and interaction while exploring.
# 13. Compete Mode (Multiplayer)
Split-screen gameplay allows two players to race simultaneously:
•	Player 1: W/S/A/D
•	Player 2: Arrow Keys
Win condition: First to complete 2 laps.
# 14. Speed Boost (Compete Mode)
Both players have access to a Speed Boost skill. Player 1 uses B, Player 2 uses P. This balances multiplayer gameplay by offering equal advantage opportunities.
# 15. Physics & Vehicle Dynamics
Karts are affected by velocity, acceleration, and friction. These mechanics create realistic handling and encourage skillful driving.
# 16. HUD & Game Feedback
The HUD adapts per mode:
•	Race HUD: Lives, Score, Lap counter, Collisions, Ammo, Boost timers.
•	Explore HUD: Coins collected, Time countdown, Skill duration.
•	Compete HUD: Player labels, Lap counters.
The feedback system ensures players always have critical information.
